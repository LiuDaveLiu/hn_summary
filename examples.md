I over-engineered a Fast Fourier Transform for Arduino<br>
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33717847<br>
This is a blog post about a man's journey to understanding and implementing the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on an Arduino Uno. He starts by researching existing solutions and finds one that is supposed to be the fastest available. He then reads the code and realizes he does not understand how it works. He spends the next month reading about the FFT and how to implement it before writing his own tutorial on the subject. He then returns to the original code and finds two ways to improve it. He also includes a section on how to use the Julia programming language for this project.(Summary based on {percentage_used}% of story text.)
